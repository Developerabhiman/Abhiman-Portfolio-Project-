## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository from GitHub:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Developerabhiman/movie-portfolio-project.git
```

Navigate to the Project Directory

```bash
   cd movie-portfolio-project
```

Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

```bash
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
    
## Usage/Examples


After setting up the environment, you can start analyzing the data:

Launch Jupyter Notebook

Start Jupyter Notebook from the command line:

```bash
   jupyter notebook
```
Open the Notebook

In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the Movie Portfolio Project.ipynb file and open it.

Run the Notebook

Execute each cell sequentially to perform the data analysis steps. The notebook is designed to guide you through the entire process, from data loading to visualization

## Features

- Data Loading and Cleaning:

   - Import data from various sources (CSV, Excel, etc.).
   - Clean and preprocess data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and formatting columns.

- Data Transformation:

  - Convert raw data into meaningful formats.
  -  Create new derived columns for better analysis.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

  - Generate summary statistics.
  - Explore relationships between different variables.
  - Visualize data distributions and correlations.

- Visualization:

  -  Create various plots and charts (e.g., histograms, bar charts, scatter plots) to visualize trends and patterns in the movie data.
  -  Use libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for enhanced visual representation.

- Predictive Modeling (Optional):

  -  Implement basic machine learning models to predict movie success metrics like revenue or ratings.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries:

-  Python 3.x
-  Jupyter Notebook
-  Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
-  NumPy: For numerical computations.
-  Matplotlib: For plotting basic graphs.
-  Seaborn: For advanced visualizations.

All dependencies can be installed via the requirements.txt file:

```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

This project doesn't require special configuration. Ensure that your Python environment has the necessary dependencies installed. If you're using large datasets, make sure your system has sufficient memory and processing power.


## Examples

 Analyzing Top Rated Movies

  - Objective: Identify movies with the highest ratings.
  - Method: Use filtering and sorting techniques to isolate top-rated movies,  then visualize the findings using bar charts.

 Revenue Analysis

  -  Objective: Determine which movies generated the most revenue.
  -  Method: Perform statistical analysis on revenue data, and visualize the top-grossing movies.

 Genre Popularity Over Time

  -  Objective: Understand which movie genres have been most popular over the years.
  -   Method: Aggregate data by genre and year, then create line plots to show trends.
    
## Troubleshooting

- Jupyter Notebook Not Launching: Ensure that Jupyter is installed correctly. If issues persist, try reinstalling it:

  ```bash
     pip install jupyter
  ```
   

- Missing Dependencies: If you encounter a ModuleNotFoundError, ensure all dependencies are installed:

  ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
   
- Visualization Issues: If plots aren't displaying within the notebook, ensure %matplotlib inline is included in the relevant cells.
